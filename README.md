# journey - best temporary game name i could come up with..

For Starters (new to git)
*In your git client, clone repo to desired location, e.g.:
	cd path_to/git/repos
	git clone https://github.com/nrolando/journey.git
*Run Unity and open project -> "journey"
	*Note: Unity should create "Library" (and maybe "Temp") folder(s) under the project root for you. These should be in the .gitignore file so they are excluded.
